      <p> In this study we are interested in assessing how people manage their E-mails. Nowadays, people are often overwhelmed with large number of E-mail 
        communications and the management of these E-mails can become a difficult day-to-day task. 
        We're interested in assessing people's E-mail response decisions and the factors that influence their decisions.</p>
        
      <p> In this task, you will be presented with a number of prototype E-mails, both personal and work related, taken from the inbox of many potential 
      E-mail users. <b>Your goal is to examine each E-mail, with the aim of assisting in their correct classification as:</b> “Phishing” or “Ham”. 
      You will also be asked to determine your confidence in this classification, and the action that you would take with each E-mail. </p>
      <p>A “Phishing” E-mail is a deceptive E-mail pretending to be from a legitimate source (e.g., bank, friend) to steal money or information. 
      A “Ham” E-mail is a legitimate email. For each successful E-mail classification, you will be rewarded with 1 point. Each point you earn will 
      translate into a monetary incentive as advertised.</p>
      
      <p>The figure below shows an example of the interface that you will use in every round. During each round you will answer two questions:  <br>
      (1) Is this a phishing email? <br>
      (2) How confident are you for your answer in question 1?<br>
      Then submit your responses by clicking on the "Done" button.</p>

      <p>This study involves three phases.<b> During Phase 1 and 3, you will NOT get any feedback</b> whether you classify the E-mails correctly or incorrectly. 
      You will only receive a summary of the points earned at the end. However, <b>in Phase 2, you will receive feedback </b>if you incorrectly classify a phishing
      email as ham. The figure below shows an example of the kind of feedback you will receive.</p>
    
      <div align="center">
      <img align="center" src="feedback.jpg" alt="Instructions">

      <br>
      
      <p>
      At the end of Phase 2 you will receive a summary of the points earned.
      <!--
      If you answer a phishing email incorrectly, you will receive the following feedback message
      You will receive one of the following 4 feedback messages depending on your actions: <br>
      1. This was a <b>ham </b>email and you detected it <b>correctly.</b><br>
      2. This was a <b>ham </b>email and you detected it <b>incorrectly.</b><br>
      3. This was a <b>phishing </b> email and you detected it <b>correctly.</b><br>
      4. This was a <b>phishing </b>email and you detected it <b>incorrectly.</b><br><br>
